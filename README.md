Features:-

Home Page
Fetch and display a list of SuperHeros (Characters) on the home page. Also create a search bar that will filter out the character based on search query. Suppose I type “bat” in the search box, it should show “batman”. 
Each search result of the superhero should have a favorite button, clicking on which superhero should be added to “My favorite superheroes” (a list).
On clicking any particular search result (any superhero), open a new page with more information about that superhero (Superhero page).
